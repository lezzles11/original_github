I chose him. This is my life. I did not think it would be possible for me. But it is. It will be.", "What is it about caring for another,  feeling love,  feeling affection,  at times desire,  that makes one shy?", "What is a person,  if not the marks they leave behind?", "But a life without art,  without wonder,  without beautiful things—she would go mad. She has gone mad. What she needs are stories. Stories are a way to preserve one’s self. To be remembered. And to forget.", "Books,  she has found,  are a way to live a thousand lives—or to find strength in a very long one.", "I want to be free. Free to live,  and to find my own way,  to love,  or to be alone,  but at least it is my choice,  and I am so tired of not having choices,  so scared of the years rushing past beneath my feet.

And I can never know in advance who it’s going to be,  whether they’ll be a man or woman,  or anything else about them.", "Because we loved each other too much and found each other too interesting. And I love that about humanity,  and in fact it’s the very reason I root for us to survive—because we are so stupid about each other.", "Maybe we’re just born to love and worry about the people we know,  and to go on loving and worrying even when there are more important things we should be doing.", "And just from my perspective,  whenever I get really lonely,  you’re the person I call.
