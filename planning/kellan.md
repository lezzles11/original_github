### Things I learned

#### IT'S ALL ABOUT ATTENTION TO DETAIL

- Know your layouts really well, quizlet is great
- Always create the UI first, will make things a lot faster
- It's more about organization (e.g., having a links file just for one animation)
- Create reusable styles (classes)
- Don't reinvent the wheel lol
- Don't change too many styles after, slow down
- doesn't hurt to spend a couple minutes making things look better

### Things to relearn

- Responsive sizing (e.g., what kind of units, what kind of layouts)
- How classes are passed in
-

  - [ ] initialize(database) => runs migration and seed files
  - [ ] cleanup => destroys database

- [ ] Create functions for database queries
- [ ] Create route tests
- [ ] write functions

- [ ] Write route tests
- [ ] Ensure that you know what you are request and what you expect the response to be
